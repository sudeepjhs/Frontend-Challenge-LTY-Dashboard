# Frontend-Challenge-LTY-Dashboard Repository

## Introduction:
This repository serves as a submission for the Frontend Challenge provided by [Tublian](https://github.com/Tublian), showcasing the skills of the developer. The project is built using modern technologies and tools.

## Dark Mode Support
This project incorporates built-in support for dark mode, making it accessible and comfortable for users who prefer darker color schemes. Dark mode not only provides a visually appealing alternative to the traditional light interface but also helps in reducing eye strain during night-time use.

### Enabling Dark Mode
To switch between light and dark themes:
1. Navigate to the dashboard's navbar.
2. Click on the user icon to open the user settings dropdown.
3. Select the "Change Theme" button. This will toggle between light and dark mode settings.

The `next-themes` plugin is utilized to seamlessly manage theme switching, ensuring that your preference is preserved across sessions.

## Technologies Used:
- **Next.js v13**: A popular React-based framework for server-side rendered applications.
- **NextUI v2**: A modern UI library for React, built on top of the emotion engine and inspired by Material Design.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds type definitions and enhances code quality.
- **Framer Motion**: A production-ready motion library for React, used to create animations and interactions.
- **next-themes**: A Next.js plugin that enables easy theming and dark mode support.
- **chart.js**: A simple yet powerful charting library that requires little to no configuration.
- **Faker.js**: A library for generating fake data such as names, addresses, and phone numbers for testing and prototyping.
